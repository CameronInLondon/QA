Data will come from the make_model table and the Vehicle_Type table

### Identify any inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Vehicles that not classed as motor will be excluded from the study. These include: 'Agricultural vehicle', 'Mobility scooter', 'Pedal cycle', 'Ridden horse', 'Tram'.

### Conclusion
Question and Answers:
“Motorists had suggested that the ‘white van man’ type of driver caused more accidents. Irrespective of which type of vehicle was associated with the highest count of accidents, can any such conclusion applied to any type of vehicle be drawn from the results?”
The data is broken down by vehicle type and does not have a personal data on the drivers, only generic data list sex and age. So it would not be possible to prove this statement.
